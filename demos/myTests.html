  //We need to use the original callback function whether a this is passed or not. If the optional this is not passed, we will use the callback regularly, though now it is stored in a var. If the this value IS passed, we will take our var and set it to the returned value of callback.bind(optionalThisObject). bind returns a copy of the callback (that's why there being two callbacks was mentioned above), this copy is bound to the optionalThisObject.
