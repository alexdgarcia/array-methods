// we "feed" our tests into the tinytest.js library by calling this tests function:
tests({ // we pass in an object as an argument to the tests function
   
  // this objects has two properties, which are really methods of this object:
  'adds numbers': function() { // 'adds numbers' is the key, the value of the key is a function. This function runs our tests

    // there is a function inside tiny test called "eq" and it determines if 2 things equal each other: the 1st arg compared to t/ 2nd arg.
    eq(6, add(2, 4)); // t/ JS f(x) we are testing is called add, and it can be found in the adder.js file.
    eq(6.6, add(2.6, 4));
  },

  // If these values evaluate succesfully, the test will pass, otherwise it will fail.
  'subtracts numbers': function() {
  	// the value on the left is what we expect the function on the right (the 2nd arg) to evaluate to:
    eq(-2, add(2, -4));
  },
